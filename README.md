"The Python Wikipediabot Framework (pywikipedia or PyWikipediaBot) is a collection of tools that automate work on MediaWiki sites. Originally designed for Wikipedia, it is now used throughout the Wikimedia Foundation's projects and on many other MediaWiki wikis. It's written in Python, which is a free, cross-platform programming language. This page provides links to general information for people who want to use the bot software."
